# Common Issues
There is a larger amount of lag due to the large amounts of scripts and building being rendered. What we would like to do as improvement is creating an overhead ai controller for enemies to reduce the script usage and figure out how to better render buildings within player view distance in order to improve performance. Also we needed to have had a lot more testing where we tried playing the game since there are numerous bugs, many due to lag. Overall, we would for future improvement redo and revise all the scripts and models to better decorate the map and make sure our features are working and not lagging so much.
### Weapons and Enemies
For the future, improvements would be made to all the gun scripts and animations in order to make sure they have reloading and ammo counter along with raycasting and bullet creation. I had kept them the way they were to show the improvement I had but for future work I would need to make each weapon work before I add more types. What also needs to be done is the implementation of a customization gui for weapons skins and more types of enemies.

### Cars
Due to the lag from having a massive amounts of assets in the game, sometimes car sounds can stutter and result in innacurate noises. Rare case that cars cannot be deleted. Future improvements would have better script optimization as the sounds
were sometimes too quiet or too loud, better gui to show preview of the car before spawning it.

### Landscape
In the future, improvements will be making the map bigger and having more details until it looks like a real downtown Boston. Also, I would implement my own weather system and have different wallpaper on the building with the night and day changes. For the city detail, I need to have dynamic wallpaper, sidewalks, and traffic lights.
