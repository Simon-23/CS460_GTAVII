Here is the list of weapons, from when I first started to when I finished, with each one showing progress with my understanding of lua and scripting weapons. I was unable to introduce the skin customization that I had stated working towards in an earlier progress report since I had greatly unexpected the depth at which I would have to learn on modeling and scripting guns. 
#### First gun script

This was my first attempt and it is very basic without any projectiles that players can visually track as you can just point and click to harm enemies.To script in lua for weapons you have to make sure you state your local variables first by setting them to a value, list, severservices that are provided by roblox or to nil, in which you can later fill out through code to change the value.The code below is the barebones of making a gun without any advance technique of ray casting to track the bullet since it is just a hit scan when you click.
